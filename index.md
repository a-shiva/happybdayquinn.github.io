## Happy Birthday Quinn!

It's been a pleasure to get to know you and become close friends over the past three years. It's somewhat unbelievable that we are almost done with college. But, we do take comfort in the many wonderful memories that we've made together along the way. From getting wrecked by 160, trips to hidden gems in Center City, organizing lineage events, and beyond, we've shared the full range of highs and lows. 

What sticks out across all these experiences is your independent-thinking and willingness to often take the road less traveled. From China to Germany, blockchain to self-driving cars, piano to Insta-photography, and many others, you are well-versed and have interests in a diverse array of things. Ultimately, life is really about the richness of experiences we have, so continue to experiment and hold onto your unique creativity and passions.

Have a fantastic 21st birthday. Looking forward to celebrating soon and getting the three musketeers back in action.
